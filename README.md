# ZOEPOOL.com
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) see documentation there.

## To Contribute
1. Clone repository
2. ```npm install``` to add depencies listed below

## Additional Dependencies
- ```@fullpage/react-fullpage``` provides the essential full page scrolling action for the site
- ```bootstrap 4.5.3``` is used for styling
- ```jquery 3.5.1``` enables the use of some bootstrap functionality
- ```react-router-dom 5.2.0``` is used for any routing that is not part of the react-fullpage scrolling action
- ```styled-components 5.2.1``` is used for custom styling

## To Do
- the purple bar gets in the way of clicking the different sections on the about page
- is it possible to maybe have that bar as something you hover over and when you hover over it that when you see the full bar?
- I think we should consider making the ZOE logo here smaller - thoughts? I think maybe we should keep it in & around the size of the purple navigation tab to left, giving it something to be anchored to.
- I think the "Dive In" section should go in the order of
    - Glossary
    - Events
    - Partners
- Classes via ```App.css``` vs ```styled-components``` are used inconsistently. Choose one and stick to it.
- On ```Dive.js```, implement Active tab

## We need links to:
- cardano.social
- abcd

## Content Questions
- Could I get your feedback & thoughts please, specifically on the Transparency & Costing section?
- Transparency - do we want to commit to a detailed activity report? what do we have in mind for this what would in this report? For the monthly updates what do they look lie, what's an update for our delegators?
- Costing - Are the prices there correct? Let me know if any adjustments need to be made.
- Are there any other sections we'd like in this document other than what's already here?
