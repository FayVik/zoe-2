    'ZOEPOOL is an African based stakepool focused on #WomenInBlockchain.',

    'ZOEPOOL is not a mirage. It is a watering hole of knowledge & rewards within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. A place where Women in Blockchain are cherished. A pool where you can quench your crypto thirst and grow your blockchain knowledge while being rewarded for simply visiting & delegating.',
    
    'ZOEPOOL intends to use a portion of its rewards to raise blockchain and financial literacy on the ground in Africa & beyond. Using funds earned from the stakepool to run educational programs that will encourage African women to follow their curiosity confidently into the blockchain ecosystem so that they can see that this is an ecosystem for all people.',
    
    'Representing Africa in the Cardano ecosystem is something we are very proud and passionate about considering there are currently less than 5 active stake pools in Africa. ZOEPOOL strives to contribute to securing the Cardano network. We aim to contribute to Cardano’s vision of creating “possibility for the many, as well as the few.”',
    
    'ZOEPOOL actively seeks to be in the position to aid small businesses run by young entrepreneurs (especially women) in the African community. Also contributing to philanthropic efforts to improve the quality of life for the not so privileged and/or talented; who are genuinely trying to make the lives of others better but may not have the resources and tools to do so.',
    
    'Remember that as ZOEPOOL is African based so know that the sun stays shining on it. ZOEPOOL wants to bring that light to anyone who comes to visit and/or delegate.'
