    'ZOEPOOL is an Africa-based stakepool focused on #WomenInBlockchain.',

    'ZOEPOOL is not a mirage. It is a watering hole of knowledge & rewards within the Cardano ecosystem. A place where Women in Blockchain are cherished. A pool where you can grow your blockchain knowledge by simply visiting, but also quench your crypto thirst by delegating your ADA.',
    
    'We intend to use a portion of our rewards to raise blockchain and financial literacy on the ground in Africa & beyond. This will be acheived by using funds earned from the stakepool to run educational programs that will encourage African women to follow their curiosity confidently into the blockchain ecosystem so they can see that this is an ecosystem for all people.',
    
    'Representing Africa in the Cardano ecosystem is something we are very proud of and passionate about. We strive to contribute to securing the Cardano network and aim to help achieve Cardano’s vision of creating “possibility for the many, as well as the few.”',
    
    'ZOEPOOL actively seeks to be in the position to aid small businesses run by entrepreneurs (especially women) in the African community. Also we want to contribute to philanthropic efforts to improve the quality of life for the not so privileged and talented; who are genuinely trying to make the lives of others better but may not have the resources and tools to do so.',
    
    'Remember that ZOEPOOL is Africa-based which means the sun stays shining here. We want to bring that light to anyone & everyone who comes to visit.'
